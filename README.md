# to-do-app

This project is to create a to-do application. The main focus is understanding and practicing proper organization in building coding projects -  
Using javascript modules in order to organize files containing similar code. The use of import/export keywords in order to pass objects, variables and classes between .js files is a tool used in this project to help organize code.
I am also using this project to practice and understand the module design pattern - wrapping sets of variables and functions in a single scope. I certaintly need to work on these a little more in depth in order to attain best practices in organizing code.

JSON was also used in order to parse objects saved to local storage - this will be touched upon later in the Odin Project.
